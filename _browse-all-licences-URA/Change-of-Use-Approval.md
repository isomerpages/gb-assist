### Application Details

<p>If you want to change the use of a property (e.g. from a shop to a restaurant, or from a restaurant to a pub), you may need to apply for planning permission for Change of Use from URA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before signing a tenancy or purchase agreement of the property, you should check if your intended use for that property can be allowed, and obtain Change of Use Approval if it is required.</p>
<p>If you are using SLA property on short term tenancy or HDB's commercial property, you are required to seek consent from SLA and HDB, respectively. No further approval from URA is needed if the proposal falls under one of the allowable uses. For more information, please refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Circulars/dc15-05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Circulars/dc15-05</a>&nbsp;for SLA properties and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Circulars/dc11-05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Circulars/dc11-05</a>&nbsp;for HDB commercial premises.</p>

<p>2. I am wondering if my proposal qualifies under the Change of Use Lodgment scheme, where I can lodge my application for instant approval at a reduced cost compared to a Change of Use&nbsp;Application. Where can I find out more about Change of User Lodgment?</p>
