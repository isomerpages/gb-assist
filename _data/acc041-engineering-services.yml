    content: The AMR replaces manual labour in the transportation of materials and semi/fully completed products around the factory floor during production process. As a collaborative robot for automated internal transportation, AMR comes with autonomous functions to identify obstacles and navigate around factory floor without need for markers or coming to a complete stop for an extended period. Cost of equipment capped at $37,500 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution28' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Autonomous Mobile Robot</a><br/><br/><br/>A probing system consists of the following attached to CNC machining centerWork Piece Touch Probe Work piece measurement/referencing Tool Setting Probe Tool setting, length, radius, breakage detectionSoftware Creates measurement program for probes on standard geometries and free-form surfaces, generates QC alerts and reportsImplementation Equipment configuration, training<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution94' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Probing System</a><br/><br/><br/>Vertical storage and retrieval system designed to save floor space, maximise vertical space for inventory storage and improve productivity for goods picking. The Carousel consists of carriers that rotate vertically and deliver stored inventory (e.g. spare parts, small parcels, electronic components) to the operator on the ground.Cost of equipment capped at $37,500 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution161' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Vertical Carousel</a><br/><br/><br/>The hydraulic nut tensioning or hydraulic torqueing wrench is used for bolting, especially in tight spaces. It prevents damage and unnecessary stress due to overtightening. Cost of equipment apped at $37,500 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution956' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Hydraulic Nut Tensioning/ Hydraulic Torqueing Wrench</a><br/><br/><br/>Consists of digital welding machines (hardware) and management software- Compute actual real-time output of voltage, reducing manual recording and computing- Allow real-time monitoring of multiple weld stations to ensure welding works are compliant - Provide data logging to track welders' performance/ productivity- Monitor power consumption and consumables- User can pre-set/control welding parameters and optimise voltage appliedCost of equipment  capped at $37,500 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1288' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Digital Welding Equipment </a><br/><br/><br/>The flange facer is a cutting tool which prepares flange faces to ensure they have a perfect seal when assembled. This ensures the integrity of the flange joint for operations. The flange facer is usually pneumatically powered.Cost of equipment capped at $37,500 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1471' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Flange Facer</a><br/><br/><br/>The  torque multiplier is a compact and lightweight tool that provides repeatable precision when tightening bolts. The torque and angle settings are determined on the display which enables a convenient way of controlling the tool. Cost of equipment capped at $20,000 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1472' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Torque Multiplier</a><br/><br/><br/>The bristle blaster/ cup brush/ power brush is a handheld tool that is used for surface preparation to effectively remove corrosion and coatings. The bristle wire tips are heat-treated to promote corrosion removal capability and prepare surface roughness up to 120 microns. Cost of equipment capped at $3,000 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1473' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Bristle Blaster / Cup Brush / Power Brush</a><br/><br/><br/>The automatic flange spreader aids the process of separating two connecting flanges for the replacement of the flange gasket. It aids the maintenance of flange joints through a safe and efficient way. Cost of equipment capped at $4,000 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1474' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Automatic Flange Spreader</a><br/><br/><br/>The automatic nut splitter is used to cut through nuts within seconds. It is very useful for removing corroded nuts where a torque tool is unable to loosen the nut. It is also safer to operate as there are no open flames unlike using traditional torching. The risk of the operator injuring his hands is also lower as compared to using  a hammer and chisel. Cost of equipment capped at $7,500 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1475' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Automatic Nut Splitter</a><br/><br/><br/>Manual welding is manpower intensive and time-consuming, depending on skills and experience of the welder. Auto welding carriage can be mounted onto steel plates or structures, and only require an operator to control the equipment. Set up and process is less tedious, with higher and consistent weld quality. Multiple welding jobs can be done at the same time when connected.Cost of equipment capped at $18,750 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1963' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Auto Welding Carriage</a><br/><br/><br/>The automated labelling machine replaces manual labelling and can be used for drums, tin cans or carboy, where applicable. Each machine can be customised to fit the unit requirement for eg. standard 200L/120L drum or 1L/3L tin cans/jerry cans.Cost of equipment capped at $37,500 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution2074' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Automated Labelling Machine </a><br/><br/><br/>A fully or semi-automated filling machine replaces manual liquid filling into drums/pallets IBC and/or other containers. The machine can be customised to fit unit requirements eg. 200L/120L drum or 1L/3L tin/jerry cans.Semi-automatic Operator involved in the process (e.g. placing the containers under nozzles, transferring containers to the next process)Fully automatic Operator ensures settings are correct, minimal mechanical adjustment requiredCost of equipment capped at $37,500 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution2075' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Liquid Filling Machine</a><br/><br/><br/>The explosion proof high pressure industrial vacuum cleaner can handle wet and dry dirt, debris, metal chippings, and liquids. It is a more efficient method of cleaning up at the worksite compared to manual means. Cost of equipment capped at $12,500 per unit<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution2076' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>High pressure industrial vacuum cleaner</a><br/><br/><br/>The high pressure rotating head features a nozzle that rotates and swivels with high flow rates at a high operating pressure. It can be fixed to various rotors and extensions to cater for cleaning different tanks/vessels.
