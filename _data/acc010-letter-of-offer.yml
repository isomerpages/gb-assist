      Only your company's Acceptor in Corppass can accept the Letter Of Offer (LOF). Viewers and Preparers are not authorised to accept the LOF.

      To find out what your Corppass role is, look for the role label next to your login account name, in the masthead.

  - title: My CEO/MD, who is authorised to accept the Letter Of Offer, has left the company. How do I update Business Grants Portal and Corppass with the new CEO/MD's details?
    content: |
      Your company's Corppass administrator just needs to assign your new CEO/MD the Business Grants Portal acceptor role, so that they can accept the Letter Of Offer.

      If you haven't submitted your grant application, update your Letter Of Offer addressee. 

      If you have submitted your application and it hasn't been approved, contact the processing agency. They will return your application, so you can update it. 

      If you have already received a Letter Of Offer, your new CEO/MD will be able to accept it when your Corppass administrator assigns them the rights. Do remember to update the grant processing agency and ACRA of the change in management.
