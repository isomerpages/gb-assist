    - title: How do I calculate the total no. of manpower working on-site?
      content: |
        This refers to the total number of employees working on-site (i.e. no longer working from home). 

        For example, your company has a total of 100 employees. 60 of your employees are required to work onsite to operate your production plant, whereas 40 of your employees are able to work from home all the time. The total number of manpower working on-site is 60. 

    - title: How do I calculate the maximum number of workers on-site at any time?
      content: |
        This refers to the maximum number of workers on site at any given time (after taking into account shift work/split team arrangements/part-time). 

        For example, your 60 employees are required to work onsite work in three shifts – a morning shift of 30 workers, a afternoon shift of 20 workers, and a night shift of 10 workers. The maximum number of workers you will have on site at any given time is 30.

      content: |
        You will need to submit the FIN/NRICs of your workers/employees that are working on-site, and the maximum number of workers on site at any given time. If your workers are working on-site, you will also need to provide the address of the work premises, and indicate whether the work premises is a production site (e.g. shipyards/ production plant) or non-production site (e.g. other workplaces/ office premise). Please note that workers deployed at production sites will be required to undergo **Rostered Routine Testing (RRT)**.

        For workers and employees that are working from home, who subsequently need to go back to site for specific reasons, you will need to submit their FIN details. 

        Only the details for Singapore Citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents, Employment Pass Holders, S Pass Holders and Work Permit Holders are required to be submitted. All other non-MOM work pass holders (e.g long-term visitor pass or ICA work pass) need not be submitted.

        Production site is defined as areas where shipbuilding/ship repair, process maintenance and construction activities are carried out. Examples of production sites includes shipyards, process plants, refineries and fabrication workshops.

    - title: If my office is located within my production site, how should I indicate so in my manpower submission?

      content: |
        You will need to click on the “Add Premises” button to key in the details of your workers/employees that are deployed across multiple sites.

      content: |
        Upon submission of the manpower details, you will receive an email acknowledgement. The AccessCode on SGWorkPass app will determine whether your submitted manpower is allowed to work on site. The AccessCode will factor in a few parameters, namely:

        - Worker’s health status 

        - Worker’s place of residence is COVID-free

        - Worker’s approval to work
