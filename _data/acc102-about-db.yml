    - title: What can I do on the GoBusiness Dashboard?
      content: |
        You can use GoBusiness Dashboard to apply for and manage licences and register your business (for individual users). 
        
        By answering a few simple questions on the e-Advisers, you will also receive personalised recommendations for what to do next, based on your unique business profile. More features will be added soon.

    - title: How is GoBusiness Dashboard different from GoBusiness Licensing?
      content: |
        GoBusiness Dashboard gives an overview of your Government-to-Business (G2B) transactions in one place, including licences. It also gives personalised recommendations with our e-Advisers, while GoBusiness Licensing is primarily for matters related to licences and permits only.

    - title: I've been using GoBusiness Licensing. Can I continue to use it?
      content: |
        Yes, you can still use GoBusiness Licensing while we are in the midst of merging the GoBusiness Singapore and GoBusiness Licensing systems.
        
        However, as we have begun to move all licences to GoBusiness Dashboard since April 2022, you're encouraged to start using GoBusiness Dashboard instead.
