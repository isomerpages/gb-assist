    - title: What are the latest requirements for marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions given the heightened situation?
      content: |
        From Thursday, 22 July 2021, the updated safe management measures for marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions are as follows:  

        ||**From 22 July 2021 to 18 August 2021**|
        |**Wedding Solemnizations**|
        |Home|Up to 10 attendees|
        |ROM/M Building|Up to 10 attendees|
        |External venues|- Up to 50 attendees (no Pre-Event Test (PET) requirement); <br/>- From 51 to 100 attendees, PET required for all attendees <br/>- Group size of up to 2 persons|
        |**Wedding Receptions**|
        |Home and ROM/M Building|Not allowed|
        |External venues|- Up to 100 attendees, PET required for all attendees; <br/>- Group size of up to 5 persons|

        These limits include the couple, but exclude the Licensed Solemnizer, and any other vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the wedding event.

        All marriage Solemnizations and wedding receptions continue to be subject to the prevailing safe management measures, such as zonal/time slot requirements and safe distancing rules. Please refer to the requirements [here](/safemanagement/sector/){:target="_blank"}. All wedding guests must strictly abide by the safe management measures, and in particular maintain social distancing and avoid mingling with others beyond their own table. Given their higher vulnerability, we also strongly discourage unvaccinated individuals from attending such events until they are fully vaccinated.

        Organisers must ensure that before entering the event, all attendees must take their temperature; and must check in to the event using TraceTogether-only SafeEntry. The venue owner/ operator or organisers should have a unique QR code for the event space, e.g. hotel ballroom or private room in a restaurant.

        For more information on SafeEntry, please refer to the link [here](/safemanagement/safeentry/){:target="_blank"}.

        Please refer to MOH’s guidelines at [go.gov.sg/pet](https://go.gov.sg/pet){:target="_blank"}. for more information on Pre-Event Test (PET), and section III for FAQs on PET requirements related to marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions.

    - title: Why are measures changed so often?
      content: |
        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation. In view of the growing local clusters and the need to minimise the likelihood of large cluster formations, we will scale down event sizes and lower the event size caps. Hence, the community safe management measures will therefore be further tightened by going back to Phase 2 (Heightened Alert).  We acknowledge that wedding couples have faced significant uncertainties over their wedding plans. Hence, as a special provision, wedding receptions will be allowed to continue with some adjustments. We will continue to monitor the evolving COVID-19 situation, however should there be further tightening, couples should be prepared to adjust their plans accordingly.

    - title: My wedding is after 18 Aug 2021 (e.g. 21 Aug 2021), can I proceed to plan for my wedding reception and how many guests can I invite?
      content: |
        These safe management measures are based on the current situation. The Government will monitor the situation closely, and review the measures accordingly. Couples and wedding organisers can take reference from the prevailing measures and should be prepared that the measures may change at any point of time, given the dynamic COVID-19 situation.

    - title: What are the safe management measures that we must follow?
      content: |
        Please refer to sector-specific requirements for marriage solemnizations [here](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector/){:target="_blank"}.

    - title: Are vendors (e.g. photographers, videographers) part of the attendee limit?
      content: |
        Vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization are excluded from the attendance limit for your solemnization but should be kept to a minimum. (Vendors who are also invited guests are part of the attendee limit).

    - title: Can the bride and groom remove face masks for the solemnization ceremony? Can the bride and groom use face shields in place of face masks? Can the rest of the attendees be unmasked for photo-taking?
      content: |
        The bride and groom must use face masks or face shields throughout the solemnization event. They may remove their masks and/or face shields for key moments of the solemnization, which includes the exchanging of vows, rings, to kiss and during march-ins/outs. However, the bride and groom must maintain a 2-metre distance from the rest of the attendees of the solemnization whenever masks and face shields are removed.

        All other attendees must wear their masks throughout the solemnization process<sup>1</sup>, even for photo-taking.

        On the use of masks and face shield, please refer to the latest guidelines [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/guidance-for-use-of-masks-and-face-shields){:target="_blank"}.

        <sup>1</sup> Children aged twelve years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time, may wear a face shield as indicated in MOH’s Advisory of 1 Jun 2020 (“Guidance for Use of Masks and Face Shields”)

    - title: How long can our solemnization ceremony last?
      content: |
        For the safety of the bride, groom, and guests, the solemnization should be kept as brief as possible.

    - title: Are pre-wedding photo shoots allowed to take place? Can face masks/ shields be removed for pre-wedding photo shoots?
      content: |
        Pre-wedding photo shoots must adhere to IMDA’s Mandatory Safety Rules for the Resumption of Content Production. Please check directly with the wedding photographer on the Safe Management Measures that must be adhered to.

    - title: What are the guidelines for the attendance limit of home Solemnizations, if I have more than 10 residents in my household?
      content: |
        For marriage Solemnizations held in a place of residence, the maximum number of attendees for the home solemnization must not exceed 10 persons. This limit includes the couple and members of hosting household, but excludes the Licensed Solemnizer and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization.

        For example, if there are 6 persons currently living in your household, the 6 residents and an additional 4 visitors can attend a solemnization in your home. The total of 10 persons counts the wedding couple but excludes the Solemnizer and vendors. Or if you live alone, you and 9 other persons, including the wedding couple, can attend a solemnization in your home, excluding the Solemnizer and vendors.

        If a place of residence has 2 or more visitors attending a home solemnization (as guests or vendors), then the individual must not accept any more visitors that day to his or her place of residence.

        For the safety of all who are attending your home solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

        - All guests must wear masks for the duration of the solemnization. The bride and groom may choose to wear face shields instead of masks for the duration of the solemnization., and may remove their face shields/masks for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, to kiss and during march-ins/ outs. Other guests must maintain a 2-metre distance from the bride and groom when they are unmasked.

        - For all other attendees, masks / face shields should be retained throughout the event, even for photo-taking.

    - title: Can I provide takeaway food after the solemnization ceremony?
      content: |
        No food or drinks are to be supplied or consumed in the room or place during a solemnization event. Takeaway food may be provided only after the solemnization ceremony is over, and must not be consumed at the solemnization venue. Once the solemnization ceremony is over, social gatherings cannot exceed 2 individuals and organisers of a solemnization should ensure that guests do not crowd around or outside the event venue to consume their takeaway food.

        Organisers of a solemnization must ensure that requirements for solemnization events are not breached. Rather than providing food for takeaway, you may wish to consider providing other tokens of appreciation such as vouchers or non-food gifts.

        If there is a queue for distributing the takeaway food, the enterprise providing the takeaway must ensure that there is at least 1m safe distancing between individuals in the queue.

    - title: What is Pre-Event Testing (“PET”)?
      content: |
        A Pre-event Test refers to a COVID-19 test taken by an attendee who wishes to enter a venue where selected events such as solemnizations or wedding receptions are being held. This attendee must have a valid negative COVID-19 test result 24 hours from the time an individual is registered in-person at the testing premise, before being allowed to enter the venue.

    - title: When is PET required for marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions?
      content: |
        - For solemnizations involving 51 to 100 attendees, PET is required for all attendees (including the wedding couple).
        - For wedding receptions involving up to 100 attendees, PET is required for all attendees (including the wedding couple).
        
        Marriage solemnizations involving 50 or fewer attendees do not require PET.
        
        The PET must be done: (i) Before entry to the solemnization or wedding reception; and (ii) At most 24 hours before the end of the event.
        
        Organisers of solemnizations and wedding receptions must ensure that PET requirements are met for such events. PET for all events, including solemnizations and receptions, will not be funded by the government; organisers or individuals are responsible for paying for their own tests.
        
        Please refer to MOH’s guidelines at [go.gov.sg/pet](https://go.gov.sg/pet){:target="_blank"} for more information on PET.
        
        All marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions will continue to be subject to the prevailing safe management measures, such as zonal/ time slot requirements and safe distancing rules.

    - title: What would exempt me/my guests from PET?
      content: |
        Please refer to MOH’s guidelines at [go.gov.sg/pet](https://go.gov.sg/pet){:target="_blank"} for more information on PET and acceptable exemption notices that must be shown to the organiser of the wedding reception and or solemnization to be allowed entry. Please refer to the Event Organiser’s/Relevant Enterprises’ Guide to PET on [go.gov.sg/pet](https://go.gov.sg/pet){:target="_blank"} for further details.

    - title: What is considered an acceptable proof of test result for attendees requiring PET?
      content: |
        Please refer to MOH’s guidelines at [go.gov.sg/pet](https://go.gov.sg/pet){:target="_blank"} on acceptable proof of test results.

    - title: Can PET be done at the solemnization or wedding reception venue?
      content: |
        Yes, but organisers will need to make their own arrangements, subject to the agreement of venue operators.

    - title: If I was recently tested and already have a negative test result, can the same COVID-19 Test Result Notice be used to attend a marriage solemnization and wedding reception with PET requirements on the same day?
      content: |
        Yes, as long as you have a negative result and the event is within the 24-hour validity window. Please refer to MOH’s guidelines at [go.gov.sg/pet](https://go.gov.sg/pet){:target="_blank"} for more information.

    - title: Can the same COVID-19 Test Result Notice be used to attend more than one solemnization/ wedding reception a day?
      content: |
        Yes, as long as you do not exceed the maximum recommended limit for social gatherings in a day, and the events are within the period of validity of the test result. However, we strongly advise against going to more than one event in a day. While PET and safe management measures serve to reduce the risk of transmissions, it is not risk-free. Attending multiple large-scale events could put you at higher risk of being infected or being a vector for infection.

    - title: Do vendors (e.g. hotel staff, caterers, photographers) or Solemnizers need to undergo PET?
      content: |
        No, unless the vendor or Solemnizer is also a guest of the solemnization or wedding reception (e.g. sits down at a table like other guests).

    - title: With PET, can we relax some of the safe management measures e.g. mask-wearing, intermingling, and allowing attendees to cross zones?
      content: |
        No, PET does not replace the need for safe management measures. PET serves to reduce the probability of an infected person entering the venue. If an infected person tests antigen negative (i.e. false negative) and attends the solemnization or wedding reception, safe management measures will reduce the likelihood of him/ her transmitting the virus to other people at the event and sparking off a large cluster of infections. Both PET and safe management measures serve to further minimise the risk of spread and protect you and your loved ones.

    - title: If most of my guests have been vaccinated, can we do away with Pre-Event Testing (PET) and Safe Management Measures?
      content: |
        Attendees who have been fully vaccinated and have a valid cleared status will not have to undergo PET. But entry checks are required for all attendees at entry and PET is needed for those who are not vaccinated. In addition, all attendees, whether vaccinated or not, will still need to adhere to safe management measures to protect unvaccinated individuals should any of the attendees be infected with COVID-19 despite the precautions taken.

    - title: Can the bride and groom choose not to cross zones for marriage solemnizations, and hence not require PET to have a marriage solemnization involving more than 50 attendees?
      content: |
        No. If the marriage solemnization involves more than 50 attendees, all attendees must undergo PET.

    - title: Is PET required for all attendees of wedding receptions with less than 50 attendees, if it adopts staggered timings? Why can’t it be required only for the wedding couple or wedding party who are allowed to attend multiple timeslots?
      content: |
        Yes, from 22 July 2021, PET is required for all attendees of wedding receptions, even if staggered timing is adopted. While PET and safe management measures serve to reduce the risk of transmissions, it is not risk-free.

    - title: For marriage solemnizations involving more than 50 attendees, can the wedding party who had undergone PET and be allowed to cross zones?
      content: |
        No, the wedding party, even if tested, will not be allowed to cross zones. While PET serves to reduce the probability of an infected person attending the event, there remains a risk of false negative results where an infected person tests antigen negative and attends the wedding. Safe management measures, such as limiting the crossing of zones, reduce the likelihood of such cases transmitting the virus to other people at the event and sparking off a large cluster of infections.

    - title: Will I be compensated if my marriage solemnization/ reception has to be cancelled because the bride/ groom receives a positive / invalid test result?
      content: |
        No. Holding a marriage event is a personal decision. Couples may wish to work out an arrangement with the venue provider and/or other vendors/service providers to account for the possibility of such a postponement, which would be the same as if the bride and groom were to fall sick or otherwise indisposed.

    - title: If we opt for solemnization via video link, what is the limit to the number of guests in the same venue? Can the bride, groom, witnesses and guests be in the same venue? 
      content: |
        For solemnizations via video-link, the prevailing home visit guidelines should be adhered to (i.e. up to 2 visitors to a home per day). The bride, groom, witnesses, and guests can be in the same location if they belong to the same household or if they are within the prevailing home visit guidelines (i.e. up to 2 visitors to a home per day). Other guests exceeding the 2 visitors allowed may wish to join in through video-link instead. Such processes through video-link ensures marriage solemnizations take place in a safe manner.

    - title: What are the attendance caps if I hold my solemnization is immediately followed by a wedding reception?
      content: |
        Solemnizations are capped at 50 attendees (PET not required), or 100 attendees (PET required for all attendees). Attendee limits include the bride and groom, and exclude the solemnizer and vendors.
        
        -	If the wedding reception is held in the same room or space as the solemnization without any break in between, the entire event will be considered a wedding reception and be subject to the wedding reception safe management measures including attendance limits, i.e. up to 100 persons (PET required for all attendees). Attendee limits include the bride and groom, and exclude the solemnizer and vendors.

        -	If organisers intend to hold separate solemnization and wedding reception events at the same venue, you are advised to have a reasonably long break between the two events. This will provide time to vacate and sanitise the venue after the first event and will also prevent interactions between the two sets of guests who are leaving or entering the venue.

    - title: Can I perform other cultural rites such as the tea ceremony during the reception?
      content: |
        Yes you may, subject to the safe management measures for receptions (e.g. no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests). For example, the tea ceremony can be held amongst the “wedding party” of up to 20 attendees as part of the reception, and must take into account the Safe Management Measures for wedding receptions. 

    - title: Can we have our tea ceremony at the solemnization venue?
      content: |
        Food and drink are not allowed during solemnization events. The tea ceremony may be held before or after the solemnization but must comply with requirements such as the social gathering size limit of 2 persons or the cap of 2 visitors a day to a place of residence. Nonetheless, the tea ceremony can be held as part of a wedding reception, amongst the “wedding party”, comprising the wedding couple and up to 18 other attendees, subject to safe management measures for wedding receptions.

    - title: Can we do our pre-wedding photo shoots on a separate day from our solemnization?
      content: |
        You may do your pre-wedding photo shoots on a separate day from your solemnization. Please check directly with the wedding photographer on the safe management measures that must be adhered to.

    - title: Can we hire a photographer to take photos of my wedding dinner/reception, and can the photographer take photos of guests at each table by adhering to the 1-metre distancing?
      content: |
        Yes, you can hire a photographer to take photos of the wedding reception. A 1-metre distance between the photographer and the subject(s) of photography must be maintained at all times. There must also be no intermingling between the wedding party and guests (i.e. table-to-table photos should be avoided). Masks must be kept on for photo-taking.

    - title: Can the bride and groom stand/ sit on the stage and take photos with the wedding party of 20?
      content: |
        Yes, they can mingle and take photos with one another within the wedding party of 20 persons (including the bride and groom). For photo-taking, at least 1-metre safe distancing must be observed between the wedding party and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times.

    - title: Can we play video screenings and/or projections of our wedding photos during the reception?
      content: |
        Yes, you can. However, there must be no activities involving live singing, cheering, loud toasting or shouting, or dancing during the reception.

    - title: Can weddings that are up to 20 pax be considered a wedding party where the hosts and guests are allowed to interact as a group?
      content: |
        Yes, if the event size is kept at 20 attendees throughout the entire wedding reception. PET would be required for all 20 attendees, including the wedding couple.

    - title: If I have a small wedding reception now, can I have another reception should the limits be increased subsequently?
      content: |
        The conditions for the holding of marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions during the COVID-19 situation will depend on the prevailing circumstances and policies. Based on the current limit of one reception per couple, a second reception is not allowed.

    - title: If there are certain guests that attend the reception purely to meet and greet the couple and leave straightaway without sitting in to eat and drink, would they be counted as part of the attendees limit?
      content: |
        The total number of attendees includes those who attend the reception for a short duration without eating or drinking, and the relevant PET requirements apply.

    - title: Are there any duration limits or time restrictions for wedding reception/solemnization?
      content: |
        Couples may choose to hold their solemnization and reception on a separate day, however, each of these events must be completed in the same calendar day. Within the calendar day of each event, there is no fixed time frame/ duration limit, but it is recommended to keep the sessions as brief as possible.

        For solemnizations in other external venues, venue operators reserve the right to impose shorter time limits based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented. For wedding receptions, please also note that liquor cannot be served or consumed after 10.30pm.

    - title: Does the set up of the ceremony allow for a stage, reception table etc?
      content: |
        A stage can be set up as part of the ceremony, but there must be no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests, or between groups of guests. A reception table is allowed, if it is to receive guests when they arrive. However, any interactions should be minimised. E-check-in or other contactless methods of registration should be adopted where possible.

    - title: Is a food line able to be set-up with safe distancing queues and served by the servers at hand?
      content: |
        Food lines are not permitted at wedding events. At receptions, guests are to be served seated at their tables, instead of queuing at the food lines. This is to minimise mingling/ crowding, and to reduce interaction amongst different groups of guests. Organisers can offer individually plated or packaged food, and should avoid shared platters or dishes. For solemnizations, food and beverages are strictly not allowed.

    - title: Is onsite cooking allowed at my wedding reception?
      content: |
        On-site cooking is allowed as long as the kitchen staff/personnel remain masked and separated from the guests (similar to a restaurant kitchen).  All respective Singapore Food Agency and Food & Beverage sector guidelines must be adhered to.

    - title: For a zoning arrangement, can I have as many zones as I want?
      content: |
        If the venue permits, you may have multiple zones subject to the overall attendance of the entire event being capped at the maximum allowable limit, the number of people in each zone not exceeding 50 attendees, and zoning rules being adhered to (including a 3-metre gap and a continuous physical barrier or a solid partition of 1.8 metre or taller between zones). These caps include the couple and the wedding party, but excludes the Solemnizer (for the solemnization), vendors engaged to provide authorised services and venue staff (to be kept to a minimum). We understand venues may have different configurations and encourage couples to work out an optimal arrangement with the venue operator. Couples may choose to configure the zones in a way that allows the wedding couple/party to access ‘central’ areas, such as the aisle and the stage. All attendees, including the “wedding party”, must be assigned to only one zone. Regardless of the number of zones, entering an unassigned zone is not allowed, except for the wedding couple, who may do so briefly e.g. to take photos. Arrangements must also be made to ensure attendees from different zones do not meet each other at entrances or exits. For instance, organisers could deploy ushers at the entrances and exits of each zone. Within each zone, there must be no intermingling and mixing between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests.

    - title: For a staggered timing arrangement for wedding receptions, can I have as many time slots as I want?
      content: |
        If the venue permits, you may have multiple time slots subject to the overall attendance of the entire event comprising the multiple time slots being capped at the maximum allowable limit, the number of people in each time slot not exceeding 50 pax, and staggered timing rules being adhered to (including a 30-minute gap between time slots). These caps include the couple and the wedding party, but excludes vendors engaged to provide authorised services and venue staff (to be kept to a minimum). The duration of the entire event must be kept within the same calendar day.

        Guests must be assigned to one time slot only, and can only be present in their assigned time slot. Only the “wedding party” (up to 20 pax) may remain between time slots, whereas all other guests must only belong to one timeslot. There must be a minimum of 30 minutes between time slots, where cleaning and disinfection at the event space (e.g. common/shared surfaces such as seats) and other common areas (e.g. toilets) must be conducted. Within each timeslot, there must be no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests i.e. a 1 metre safe distance between these groups must be observed.

        Venue operators may impose shorter time limits as they deem fit, based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented.

    - title: Why is the wedding party allowed to remain for each time slot in a staggered timing arrangement, but not allowed to cross zones in a zoning arrangement?
      content: |
        Both arrangements adhere to the safety principle that there should be no more than 50 persons at one place (zone) at one time (time slot). Within each zone or timeslot, there must similarly be no intermingling and mixing between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests. In a zoning arrangement, only the wedding couple is allowed to cross zones briefly (e.g. to take photos).

        In a staggered timing arrangement, the wedding party is allowed to remain in each timeslot as it is the only way for them to host the wedding throughout the entire event. However, like the physical zoning arrangement, the wedding party must not be intermingling with other groups, and prevailing safe distancing rules i.e. 1m distance between groups, must be observed. Additional safety measures must be taken such as requiring a minimum of 30 minutes between time slots, where cleaning and disinfection at the event space (e.g. common/shared surfaces such as seats) and other common areas (e.g. toilets) must be conducted.

    - title: Is the wedding party included in the 50-per-zone cap?
      content: |
        Yes. There must be no more than 50 people in each zone, and each attendee (including the wedding party) must be assigned to only one zone. Couples may choose to configure the zones in a way that allows the wedding couple/party to access ‘central areas’, such as the aisle and the stage. Regardless of the number and configuration of zones, entering unassigned zones, except for the wedding couple who may do so briefly e.g. to take photos.

    - title: Can I split my wedding party across zones?
      content: |
        Yes. However, once the wedding party is split across zones, they can no longer enter other unassigned zones or interact with other members of the wedding party that are in separate zones during the event. There is an exception for the wedding couple, who may cross zones briefly e.g. to take photos, but at least 1m safe distancing must be observed between the couple and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times, including for photo-taking.

    - title: Can the wedding party cross zones?
      content: |
        No, like any attendee, each member of the wedding party must be assigned to one zone only and not enter unassigned zones. There is an exception for the wedding couple, who may cross zones briefly e.g. to take photos, but at least 1m safe distancing must be observed between the couple and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times, including for photo-taking. This is to reduce the overall risk exposure for members of the wedding party as well as guests in each zone.

    - title: Can the zone with the wedding party have more than 50 attendees?
      content: |
        No, the number of people in each zone is capped at 50 attendees. This includes the wedding party.

    - title: Can I split my reception into lunch and dinner at the same venue on the same day?
      content: |
        Yes. You may split your reception into lunch and dinner if it is at the same venue and entire event is completed within a day. This is subject to the overall attendance of the entire event being capped at the maximum allowable limit, the number of people in each time slot not exceeding 50 pax, and staggered timing rules being adhered to (including a 30-minute gap between time slots). These caps include the couple and the wedding party, but excludes vendors engaged to provide authorised services and venue staff (to be kept to a minimum). The duration of the entire event must be kept within the same calendar day.

        Guests can only arrive and leave in their scheduled timeslot. Only the wedding party (up to 20 pax) may remain between time slots, whereas all other guests must only belong to one timeslot. There must be a minimum of 30 minutes between time slots, where cleaning and disinfection at the event space (e.g. common/shared surfaces such as seats) and other common areas (e.g. toilets) must be conducted. Within each timeslot, there must be no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests i.e. a 1 metre distance between these groups must be observed.

        Venue operators may impose shorter time limits as they deem fit, based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented.

    - title: Can I split my wedding party across time slots?
      content: |
        Yes. In a staggered timing arrangement, the wedding party is allowed to remain in each timeslot as it is the only way for them to host the reception throughout the day. If you prefer, you may split your wedding party across time slots.

    - title: For a staggered timing arrangement, can I hold my wedding reception at different venues?
      content: |
        Wedding receptions across different premises are not allowed, although the event may take place in multiple rooms within the same premises managed by the same operator. The couple should provide the full name list of attendees across the different rooms to the venue operator. The entire reception must be completed within the same calendar day and the attendance in different rooms is subject to the maximum allowable limit for a wedding reception.

    - title: For a staggered timing arrangement, can I have my wedding reception across different days?
      content: |
        No. Couples can only hold one reception, which limits the total risk exposure. Even in a staggered timing arrangement, the entire reception must be completed within the same day.

    - title: My wedding venue is large enough to accommodate more than 100 attendees for marriage solemnization or wedding receptions with appropriate safe distancing between groups of 2 (for solemnization) and 5 (for wedding reception), is zoning of 50 still necessary?
      content: |
        Yes. Regardless of venue, the number of people in each zone is capped at 50 attendees. All attendees are to be assigned one zone only and entering an unassigned zone is not allowed. This is to minimise participants’ total risk exposure and the risk of bunching at common areas including entrances and exits. Organisers are to ensure at least 3m distance between zones with the use of physical barriers e.g. queue poles, or use a solid partition of 1.8 metres or taller between zones. Organisers must also undertake measures to avoid guests crossing between zones. Arrangements must also be made to ensure attendees from different zones do not meet each other at entrances or exits. For instance, organisers could deploy ushers at the entrances and exits of each zone.

    - title: What are the requirements/guidelines for cleaning and disinfection during the intervals between time slots?
      content: |
        There must be a minimum of 30 minutes between time slots, where cleaning and disinfection at the event space and other common areas must be conducted. Before the start of each time slot and where applicable, the venue owner/ operator or organisers must clean and disinfect function spaces, common facilities (e.g. toilets), tables and chairs before and after use, including high-touch areas such as handrails, door handles, lift buttons, etc. It is a good practice for the venue owner/ operator or organisers to provide disinfecting agents like hand sanitisers, disinfectant sprays, wipes, etc. for attendees and staff at common or high-touch areas.

    - title: Are common areas such as toilets subject to zonal restrictions?
      content: |
        Organisers are encouraged to designate specific common areas and facilities to specific zones. If this is not possible, organisers should identify hotspots e.g. entry/ exit points, washrooms, corridors, etc. for potential bunching and implement a control mechanism to prevent/ disperse crowds e.g. staggered entrances and exits. This could include the deployment of Safety Ambassadors to remind attendees against clustering and loitering in common areas. Where possible, common surfaces should be wiped down after each use.

    - title: If the wedding party is only part of one zone, does it mean they cannot take photos with guests from the other zone?
      content: |
        Only the wedding couple is allowed to cross zones briefly to take photos. The rest of the wedding party are not allowed to cross zones, like all other attendees. For photo-taking within zones, at least 1m safe distancing must be observed between groups, as well as between the “wedding party” and other groups, at all times, including for photo-taking.

    - title: Do the vendor staff and photographer have to be assigned to zones as well? Can they cross zones?
      content: |
        Vendor staff need not be confined to zones, as they come into contact with participants only transiently and are always masked. The photographer may follow the wedding couple across zones for photo-taking.

    - title: My wedding plans are affected by the COVID-19 restrictions and I am unable to reach mutual agreement with my vendors. However, my wedding is not scheduled to be held between 8 May 2021 to 31 July 2021, what can I do?
      content: |
        Couples and their vendors including venue operators should work out mutually acceptable arrangements. Given the fluid COVID-19 situation, we hope that all parties can exercise flexibility and mutual understanding in adjusting their plans.
