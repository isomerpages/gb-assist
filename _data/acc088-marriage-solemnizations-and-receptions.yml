        <sup>1</sup> This is in accordance with Fire Safety considerations.<br>
        <sup>2</sup> Where VDS is required, it means that checks must be implemented to ensure that every attendee<br> 
        a) is fully vaccinated i.e. has received the appropriate regimen of World Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines including their respective duration post-vaccination for the vaccine to be fully effective, and had their vaccination records ingested in MOH’s national IT systems. From 14 February 2022, persons aged 18 years old and above who have completed the primary vaccination series and are eligible for booster vaccination will be considered as fully vaccinated for 270 days after the last dose in their primary vaccination series. Upon receiving their booster, they will continue to be considered as fully vaccinated beyond the 270 days. The same will apply to persons aged 12 to 17 years old from 14 March 2022; or<br>

      content: |
        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation, and will continue to review the safe management measures and community related activities. However, should there be further tightening, couples should be prepared to adjust their plans accordingly.

    - title: What are the safe management measures that we must follow?
      content: |
        Please refer to sector-specific requirements for marriage solemnizations [here](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: My marriage solemnisation/wedding reception is held in a food and beverage (F&B) establishments and with less than 500 attendees. Will VDS, including having TraceTogether and SafeEntry checks be required for my event?
      content: |
        Where the event is held at F&B establishments, VDS is required for dining-in customers. However, F&B establishment will no longer need to conduct VDS entry checks for their customers. Couples and organiser should advise the attendees that VDS is still required, and the onus will be on the attendees to abide by the rules.

    - title: Can the bride and groom remove face masks for the solemnisation ceremony or wedding reception? Can the bride and groom use face shields in place of face masks? Can the rest of the attendees be unmasked for photo-taking?
      content: |
        As a special provision, the bride and groom may be unmasked throughout the marriage solemnisation (excluding ROM/M Building) or wedding reception event. To enjoy the unmasking provision, the wedding couple is required to (i) undergo an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) minimally supervised by the venue operator<sup>3</sup> (either in person or virtually); or (ii) have a valid Pre-Event Test (PET) within 24 hours prior to the end of the event.

        Should the bride and groom opt not to undergo the ART or PET, they may remove their face shields or mask for key moments only (e.g. when exchanging vows for rings, kiss, march-in/outs).

        Mask-wearing continues to be required for indoor settings but is optional in outdoor settings. However, we encourage individuals to wear their masks even when outdoors for personal protection and to protect others, especially in crowded areas<sup>4</sup>.  Masks may be removed momentarily for photo-taking and must be worn immediately after.

        On the use of masks and face shield, please refer to the latest guidelines [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/general/faqs---masks-and-personal-protective-equipment-(ppe)#:~:text=A%3A,of%20transmission%20of%20COVID%2D19){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        <sup>3</sup> Venue operator refers to the party that has charge, management or control of the room or place where the event takes place, during the period of the event.
        <sup>4</sup> Children aged twelve years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time, may wear a face shield as indicated in MOM's Advisory of 1 Jun 2020 (“Guidance for Use of Masks and Face Shields”)

    - title: As a wedding couple, I would like to be unmasked for my solemnisation / reception, but my venue operator is not available to supervise my ART. What can I do?
      content: |
        If you are unable to do an ART minimally supervised by the venue operator (either in person or virtually), you can opt to have a valid PET obtained within 24 hours prior to the end of the event. Otherwise, the wedding couples can choose to wear a face shield instead of a face mask, and to remove the face shield for the key moments (e.g. when exchanging vows for rings, kiss, march-in/outs). 

    - title: Are pre-wedding photo shoots allowed to take place? Can face masks/ shields be removed for pre-wedding photo shoots?
