    - title: Should my employees be masked at all times? What if my worker has medical condition?
      content: |
        Every individual should put on a mask at all times when indoors, except when:

        a) not interacting in person with another individual present in that area and employees are not in customer-facing areas where interaction is likely to happen; 
        
        b) eating, drinking or consuming medication; 
        
        c) engaging in strenuous physical exercise; or
        
        d) other equipment must be worn during the course of work (e.g. motorcycle helmets). 
        
        However, if the individual has severe medical conditions, he may wear a face shield in lieu of a mask.
        
        Mask wearing in outdoor settings, e.g. worksites that are not sheltered is optional.

    - title: Are there any available resources to help my business review work processes to enable employees to work-from-home?

    - title: Are employees and visitors required to wear a mask at all times at the workplace?
      content: |
        For general office workplaces that are indoors, employers must ensure that employees and visitors wear a mask at all times at the workplace, except when:
        
        a) not interacting in person with another individual present in that area and employees are not in customer-facing areas where interaction is likely to happen; 
        
        b) eating, drinking or consuming medication; 
        
        c) engaging in strenuous physical exercise; or
        
        d) other equipment must be worn during the course of work (e.g. motorcycle helmets). 
        
        Notwithstanding the above, employees are encouraged to exercise social responsibility and maintain an appropriate safe distance from others when unmasking.
        
        Mask-wearing in outdoor setting, e.g. worksites that are not sheltered is optional. 

    - title: What are considered physical interactions settings that still require individuals to put on masks?
      content: |
        Settings with physical interactions may include meetings where participants are engaged in conversations. 

    - title: Can employees seated apart at meetings be unmasked?
      content: |
        No. Employees are likely to be engaged in conversations during meetings. Therefore, they are likely to be interacting in person with another individual, even though they may be seated apart. Hence, they are required to wear mask.

    - title: Do my employees have to wear a mask when they are not attending to customers in customer-facing areas in the workplace?
      content: |
        Yes. Employees have to wear a mask in customer-facing areas as these are areas where interaction is likely to happen. Beyond the operating hours when customers are not expected to enter the area, mask wearing can be made optional. 
      
        Some examples of customer-facing areas include reception area, showrooms, building lobby, etc. 

    - title: Can employers impose mask-wearing rules beyond prevailing requirements in their workplaces?
      content: |
        Yes. Employers can impose mask-wearing rules above and beyond existing requirements with consideration to workplace safety and health and operational needs.

        Conversely, employees may also choose to continue wearing masks if they prefer or feel uncomfortable being unmasked while working indoors.

    - title: What forms of personal protective equipment should my employees use? Can employees wear other forms of PPEs (e.g. face shields) instead of surgical masks?
      content: |
        A mask that closely and completely covers the nose and mouth (i.e. without leaving a gap between the mask and the face) should be worn in indoor settings while at the workplace, except when:

        a) not interacting in person with another individual present in that area and employees are not in customer-facing areas where interaction is likely to happen; 
        
        b) eating, drinking or consuming medication; 
        
        c) engaging in strenuous physical exercise; or
        
        d) other equipment must be worn during the course of work (e.g. motorcycle helmets). 
        
        The following specific groups of persons may use a face shield, in place of masks:
        
        1. Children 12 years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time; 
        
        2. Persons who have health conditions that may result in breathing or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period of time; and
        
        3. Persons who are speaking to a group in a classroom or lecture-style setting, where they largely remain at the spot from which they are speaking, and are able to maintain a safe distance away from any other persons. 

        A face shield has to be must be worn properly so that it covers the entire face, from the forehead to below the chin, wrapping around the sides of the face.
        
        Plastic spit guards predominantly cover the mouth and are not considered as masks. Face coverings such as neck gaiters, bandannas, scarves or handkerchiefs are not considered as masks.
        
        If the risk of encountering an infectious person is high (e.g. personnel has sustained contact with many other individuals throughout the course of their work), then surgical masks and other relevant PPEs should be used instead.

    - title: Can my employees use employer-provided recreational facilities which are not located at the workplace?
      content: |
        Access to standalone recreational facilities which are located away from employees' workplaces will depend on the re-opening plans for relevant permitted enterprises. These facilities will also be subject to stricter safe management measures. When visiting such facilities, employees will still have to comply with the relevant safe management measures in place for that setting.
    
    - title: Can I be unmasked while giving a speech during a work-related event?

    - title: What should I take into consideration when engaging employees on returning to the workplace?
      content: |
        You are encouraged to have a transparent and open discussion with employees on the work arrangements, taking into consideration factors such as: 
        
        - Business needs and nature of work, i.e. task requires employees to be physically in office
        - Readiness of workforce, e.g. infrastructure, IT support, onboarding of new hires, etc.
        - Implications on remuneration package, e.g. savings from office space rental, transport allowances, etc. 
        - Sensitivity towards certain groups of employees, i.e. older and more vulnerable employees, employees identified by MOH as not suitable to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, employees with caregiving needs

        Having a clear set of guidelines or workplace policies on the work arrangements would help prevent misunderstandings or disputes.

      content: |
        No. Common spaces include entrances, lifts lobbies, meeting rooms, pantries as well as shared machinery and equipment should be cleaned in accordance with [NEA's advisory](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/guidelines){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. You are not required to enlist a cleaning contractor. 

    - title: One of my workers is infected with COVID-19, and I want to conduct ART for employees who might have been in contact. What type of interactions should count?
      content: |
        You should make an assessment based on your workplace setting. For instance, those whom the infected worker had meals with, or those who were at a long meeting with them, may be at risk of infection. You may wish to conduct ART to ensure that they are safe and reduce transmission risk.

        It is important that employers and employees remain socially responsible to lower the risk of transmission at the workplace so as to prevent potential disruption to their operations if more workers are infected.

    - title: Do I need to maintain 1m safe distance during a business meeting?
