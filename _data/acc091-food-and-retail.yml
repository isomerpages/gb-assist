    - title: Will there be updates on the GoBusiness portal for businesses, e.g. what are the permissible activities?
      content: |
        Please refer to the Safe Management Measures and guidelines stipulated in the sector-specific advisories on the GoBusiness portal.

    - title: Am I allowed to operate at full capacity during this time?  Or must we limit work to specific hours or at certain manpower limits?
      content: |
        From 26 April 2022, all workers may now return to the workplace. 

        Notwithstanding the mask-on requirement in indoor settings, workers are allowed to remove their masks at the workplace: 

        - when they are not interacting physically with others and 

        - when they are not in customer-facing areas. 

        While this concession will provide some flexibility for workers as more return to the workplace, everyone is advised to exercise social responsibility and maintain an appropriate safe distance from others while unmasked. 

        Even with these changes, we encourage employers to retain and promote flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting and staggered work hours, as a permanent feature of the workplace. Beyond the workplace benefits of flexible work arrangements, this will also help workers avoid peak period crowds as more of us return to the workplace.

    - title: Do I need to send my staff for regular testing under the FET regime?

        F&B establishments, malls, large standalone stores and supermarket outlets, as well as those in personal care services (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services) are no longer required to conduct Fast and Easy Test Rostered Routine Testing, or FET RRT. 

        Companies that have remaining kits that were already distributed to them for RRT are strongly encouraged to continue testing until the test kits are fully utilised. There is no need for companies to submit these test results onto Swab Registration System.

    - title: What is the prevailing permissible group size for dining-in at F&B establishments like restaurants, hawker centres and coffee shops?
      content: |
        There is no longer a limit on group sizes for vaccinated individuals dining in at F&B establishments, including hawker centres and coffee shops. F&B establishments should continue to inform customers that only fully vaccinated persons may dine in, e.g. by putting up notices on their premises. Unvaccinated individuals are not allowed to dine-in and may continue to only take-away food from F&B establishments. 

        Safe distancing is also no longer required between individuals or groups dining in at F&B establishments.

        Dining-in remains a high-risk activity because many people will be unmasked and in close proximity to one another. Thus, customers should put on their masks as soon as they have finished eating or drinking.

    - title: Do I need to conduct VDS checks in my F&B establishment? 
      content: |
        Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs (VDS) continue to apply for dining in at F&B establishments. However, F&B establishments no longer need to conduct VDS checks for their customers, which is already the case for hawker centres and coffee shops. <b>The onus will be on individuals dining in to abide by the rules.</b> 

        <b>F&B establishments should continue to inform customers that VDS is required for dining in</b>, e.g. by putting up notices on their premises informing customers that only customers who meet any of the following criteria may dine in:

        a.	Are fully vaccinated<sup>2</sup>; 

        b.	Have recovered from COVID-19<sup>3</sup>; or

        c.	Are unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in or after 2010); or

        d.	Are certified to be medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme. Medically ineligible individuals will need to show the ‘vaccination exemption’ status via the Trace-Together App/Token, HealthHub or present a hard copy memo<sup>4</sup> issued by a General Practitioner (GP) clinic, public or private healthcare institution, along with a government-issued photo identification card for entry into these premises. More details on the criteria for medical ineligibility can be found in the sample of the standard memo [here](https://go.gov.sg/acceptabledocs){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
        
        Random spot checks will be done by enforcement agencies to ensure that only fully vaccinated individuals are dining in at such establishments. 

        Refer to [MOH's information sheet](https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details of the requirements for VDS.

        <sup>2</sup> This means they must have received the appropriate regimen of World Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines. Those aged 12 and above who have completed the primary vaccination series would require a booster dose to maintain the vaccination status. For more information, refer to MOH's information sheet on the requirements for VDS.<br>  
        <sup>3</sup> Currently, all recovered persons from COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated are given a 180-day exemption after infection to enter the F&B establishment for dine in. From 1 June 2022, all recovered persons will need to receive the booster dose within 9 months of their last primary vaccination dose, in order to maintain their vaccinated status.<br>
        <sup>4</sup> To be certified as medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme, individuals may visit a doctor familiar with their medical condition, or alternatively, any clinic or hospital to obtain a hardcopy doctor-certified memo.

Such children need not be from the same household to be included within a group for dine in. Unvaccinated children do not need to be accompanied by an adult when dining in. 

        <sup>5</sup> From 1 March 2022, those born in 2009 who turn 13 in 2022 will need to be fully vaccinated to dine in.

      content: |
        In indoor settings<sup>6</sup>, including F&B establishments, customers should put on their masks as soon as they have finished eating or drinking. Mask wearing in outdoor settings is optional. However, we encourage individuals to exercise precaution (for example, wear their masks in crowded outdoor areas).

They include office buildings, shopping malls and public transport (i.e. when commuting in trains and buses), and hawker centres and coffee shops. Places which are sheltered but which are not enclosed at the sides and allow open access generally will be regarded as outdoor areas. For example, HDB void decks, retail block walkways (including where coffee shops outdoor seats may be located) and bus stops will be regarded as outdoor areas. For F&B establishments with Outdoor Refreshment Areas (ORAs) that are not covered or substantially enclosed, the ORAs can be considered outdoor areas.
