  - title: Are all face-to-face lessons at private residences, tuition centres and enrichment centres allowed to continue?
    content: |
      In light of the ongoing COVID-19 situation, MOE strongly encourages that all tuition and enrichment classes be conducted online, and telecommuting be the default arrangement.

      For tuition and enrichment classes that choose to continue in-person instruction, the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) announced on 20 July 2021 that Safe Management Measures will be tightened to the Phase Two (Heightened Alert) national stance from 22 July 2021 through 18 August 2021 (both dates inclusive).

  - title: What are the safe management measures that should be implemented for tuition and enrichment centres that are allowed to continue on-premise instruction?
    content: |
      MOE strongly encourages that all tuition and enrichment classes be conducted online, and telecommuting be the default arrangement. For centres that continue on-premise instruction, to reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19, they are required to abide by the nationwide safe management measures for workplaces. These include health checks, the use of SafeEntry to support contact tracing for all employees, students and other visitors, wearing of masks at all times, and regular cleaning of common facilities and high-touch areas. More details are available at the GoBusiness website [https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/general/](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/general/).

      Tuition and enrichment centres must ensure that work-from-home is the default arrangement for employees who are able to do so. 

      As a default, the following applies to all centres conducting on-premise instruction (whether indoors or outdoors and regardless of activity), except where there are additional safe management measures that apply for higher-risk activities such as sports or physical activity, dance,  voice training, and speech and drama classes (please refer to Q3  for details for these classes).

      a. **Safe distancing**. Safe distancing measures for centres which are allowed to continue on-premise instruction are:

        i. <u>Students</u>: Centres must ensure safe distancing between students by putting up appropriate floor demarcations and/or physical barriers, e.g. using safety tape. There must also be strict separation between students in different classrooms at all times, with no intermingling.

          I. As a default, centres must ensure that all students maintain safe distancing of at least 1m at all times, with strictly no physical interaction between students. 
          II. If it is not possible to apply 1m safe distancing between students and some interaction is unavoidable, centres may instead organise students into groups of no more than five students, with strictly no physical interaction or intermingling between different groups. Centres must strictly maintain a minimum of 1m spacing between groups, although MOE advises 2m spacing between groups as a best practice.
        
        ii. <u>Tutors/instructors</u>: Tutors/instructors are advised to minimise contact with students, If some interaction is unavoidable, contact with students should be transient, and they should remain at the front of the class as much as is practicable.

        iii. <u>Capacity</u>: No single room within a centre should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors, even as the above measures are adopted.

        iv. Centres are also reminded that per MOMâ€™s guidelines for workplaces, should there be staff deployed on site, centres must strictly ensure that there is  be no cross-deployment across worksites to reduce the risk of infection caused by inter-mingling. More information on prevailing workplace SMMs can be found on the MOM website [https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}.

      b. **Health declarations**. Centres should not permit students who are placed on Leave of Absence (LOA) or Approved Absence (AA) by their schools, or students and staff who are on a Stay Home Notice (SHN), or Home Quarantine Order (HQO) to enter the centre premises. We also advise centres to watch out for staff and students with fever or respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, breathlessness, runny nose, loss of sense of smell, cough, or sore throat. Staff and students with the above symptoms or who are unwell should be advised to leave the centre and see a doctor immediately, and should not be allowed to attend lessons. As a best practice, centres should also check if a family member living in the same household is unwell. If so, the child should not attend lessons in person.

      c. **Disinfection of surfaces**. All surfaces in classrooms must be thoroughly disinfected between classes. Sharing of all equipment (e.g. props, microphones) should be avoided as far as possible. If this cannot be done, the equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and/or disinfected before being handled or used by others.

      d.	**Masks must be worn as a default at all times**, except for persons allowed to use face shields instead of masks (e.g. persons with health conditions resulting in breathing/medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period). Instructors are expected to wear a surgical mask <u>or reusable masks of equivalent effectiveness</u> at all times.

      e.	**Class timings**. Centres must allocate at least 15 minutes between classes. This is to allow adequate time to disinfect classroom surfaces, and to ensure strict separation of individuals from different classes. Centres should also work out attendance and dismissal arrangements that help avoid congestion of individuals in or outside the centre. 

      f.	**Ventilation**. All premises should abide by the latest guidance on improving ventilation and indoor air quality in buildings amid the COVID-19 situation, available on the [NEA website](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/advisories/guidance-on-improving-ventilation-and-indoor-air-quality-in-buildings-amid-the-covid-19-situation){:target="_blank"}.

      Centres should also abide by other sector-specific Safe Management Measures available on the [GoBusiness website](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector/), and to prevailing circulars issued by the Government. 

  - title: Some tuition and enrichment classes involve high movement activities (e.g. sports, dance), or activities which carry a higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread (e.g. singing, wind/brass instruments). What additional safe management measures should be implemented?
    content: |
      All classes involving indoor mask-off activities are to be suspended. For indoor mask-on activities, as well as outdoor physical activity classes, additional safe management measures apply: 
      
      For all sport or physical activity classes, as well as outdoor dance classes, please refer to the advisory issued by [Sport Singapore](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/Newsroom/Media-Releases){:target="_blank"}.

      All singing classes, classes involving the playing of instruments that require the intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind/brass instruments), and classes involving mask-off activities are to be suspended. For indoor dance classes, voice training, and speech and drama classes, please refer to the advisory issued by the [National Arts Council](https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Safe-Management-Measures-for-the-Arts-and-Culture-Sector-.html){:target="_blank"}.

      All coaches, instructors and staff who were placed on the mandatory Fast and Easy Testing (FET) regime from mid-July (e.g. if they come into contact with participants/students who are engaged in unmasked activities, including but not limited to dance, singing, wind/brass instruments, voice, theatre training (including speech and drama, actor training), physical education and other sports-related activities) would not be required to conduct FETs between 22 Jul and 18 Aug 2021 <u>**only if** their business operations are entirely suspended</u>. Organisations and individuals who continue their operations (e.g. by offering mask-on activities) must continue with their regular 14-day FET requirement. For more details on the implementation of FET, please refer to the notification issued by [National Arts Council](https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Fast-and-Easy-Testing-for-Higher-Risk-Arts-Instruction-Activities.html){:target="_blank"}, and the notification issued by [ActiveSG](https://www.myactivesg.com/read/2021/7/a-safe-and-gradual-resumption-of-sport-and-fitness-activities-with-mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing){:target="_blank"}.

  - title: What are the safe management measures that should be implemented for face-to-face lessons operating out of private residences?
    content: |
      MOE strongly encourages that all tuition and enrichment classes be conducted online, in light of the uncertain situation. For home-based tuition/enrichment that conduct face-to-face lessons, subject to the prevailing national group size limit and number of unique household visitors allowed per day.

      Home ventilation should be improved by opening doors and windows. Fans can be used to promote air circulation when needed.
      
      More information about safe management measures for home-based services are available at the MOH [website](https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19/faqs){:target="_blank"}.

  - title: Are private schools, including tuition and enrichment centres, allowed to hold year-end concerts or performances on their premises?
    content: |
      All indoor live performances by tuition and enrichment centres scheduled to take place 22 July through 18 August 2021 (both dates inclusive) are to be deferred/postponed to reduce the risk of transmission.

  - title: Will Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses for adults be allowed to continue?   
    content: |
      All training providers are strongly encouraged to continue conducting CET training online.
      
      For health and safety reasons, the maximum class size for all other in-person CET activities is capped at 50 persons (including the trainer(s)). For SSG-funded CET programmes, SSGâ€™s prevailing guideline for a maximum class size of 40 persons (excluding the trainer(s)) for course quality reasons remains and takes precedence. This is subject to safe management requirements in Q2.. All CET activities involving indoor mask-off activities are to be suspended. For all other Sport or Physical Activity, Dance, Voice Training, Speech and Drama Classes, please refer to Q3.

  - title: Can private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions be held in external venues (e.g. function rooms)? 
    content: |
      Private tuition/enrichment classes, and training sessions by the Institutes of Higher Learning and SSG-funded training providers, can be conducted at external venues, if those venues are open. Such external venues may include condominium function rooms, private conference and meeting rooms, etc.

      Conduct of face-to-face lessons is subject to premise capacity caps and safe management measures (see Q4). Private providers should approach premise owners for advice on the capacity caps for their respective venues. No single room should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors/trainers, subject to further capacity limits for masked sports/dance/speech/voice training/drama classes, or the premise capacity cap, <u>whichever is lower</u>. 

      There should be a wipe-down regimen after each use at such external venues. Private providers must also adhere to the safe management guidelines for private tuition/enrichment and CET courses, which are outlined in the FAQs within this section. 

  - title: I am a private provider / Allied Health Professional offering services for students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) or disabilities. May I provide services and what are the safe management measures that I need to adhere to?
    content: |
      Registered Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) defined as professionals regulated by the Allied Health Professions Council and psychologists registered with the Singapore Psychological Societyâ€™s Register of Psychologists can provide consultation and assessment services for students with special educational needs or disabilities.  These AHPs should adhere to sector-specific guidelines, prevailing precautionary measures and safe distancing requirements, as well as infection and control measures such as hand hygiene and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) guidelines relevant to each setting.

      For Early Intervention (EI) services provided to pre-school children (aged 0 - 6), please refer to ECDAâ€™s guidelines on EI services.  

      In addition to aligning with MOH guidelines on healthcare services, group therapy for all non-public Healthcare Institutions AHS, including psychology services, is capped at a maximum of 2 clients per session (count excludes AHPs and support staff).

  - title: Will the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system and the SafeEntry Gateway Device (SEGW) be implemented for tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers?
    content: |
      On 4 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced that TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SafeEntry) will be implemented at all venues that experience higher throughput of visitors, and/or where people are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods from 17 May 2021. The TT programme and SafeEntry are important digital tools that enable contact tracers to quickly identify and isolate close contacts of COVID-19 cases. This helps to break transmission chains and prevent community outbreaks. TT tokens may be collected at designated collection points (please refer to [https://token.gowhere.gov.sg](https://token.gowhere.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} for more information).

      Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers must therefore ensure that TT-only SafeEntry is implemented in your premises, and that entry to your centres will be allowed only if the individual uses their TT App to scan the centreâ€™s QR code or presents the QR code on the TT token to be scanned. This includes staff, students aged 7 years and above, parents and other visitors.

      It is mandatory for all tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers to deploy SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) to facilitate SafeEntry (SE) check-in for students aged 7 years and above, parents, staff and visitors, and help users check that their TT token is working. Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers are reminded to download the SafeEntry (Business) app to use the SEGW function or register for a SEGW box on the SE website (go.gov.sg/gateway-overview). Centres should maintain attendance records for children below 7 to facilitate contact tracing if required.  

      At the point of entry into the centres, if any student forgets to bring their TT token, they should be asked to download the TT app on their phones before they are allowed entry. However, if the student is unable to do so (e.g. phone is out of battery), the studentâ€™s personal details should be noted down as a last resort, before the individual is granted entry. The centre should retain all such records for at least a month to facilitate contact tracing if necessary. 

      Business may refer to the SafeEntry User Guide for requirements on how to scan the TT tokens, available at [https://www.safeentry.gov.sg](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}(please navigate to Resources > User Guide > SafeEntry NRIC User Guide for Business). Updates may also be found at [https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/whats-new/press-releases](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/whats-new/press-releases){:target="_blank"}.

  - title: Will private tutors providing face-to-face classes operating out of private residences be required to implement the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system?
    content: |
      As with tuition and enrichment centres (see Q9), private tutors providing face-to-face classes operating out of private residences will need to implement TT-only SafeEntry.

  - title: Can MOE help to facilitate a refund of the fees I had already paid for the period where face-to-face classes were suspended for students aged 18 years and younger?
    content: |
      As matters pertaining to the payment of fees is a contractual matter and practices vary across different providers, we advise parents, guardians and affected students to work with and seek an amicable resolution directly with the private provider in question.

  - title: Can private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions provide food and drinks to students?
    content: |
      In line with the prevailing safe management measures, food and drinks should not be provided. Students should keep their masks on at all times, and not consume any food and drinks during classes, as far as possible.

  - title: Can private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions involving transient mask-off activities such as food tasting be allowed to continue?
    content: |
      To reduce the risks of community transmission, students are required to keep their masks on throughout class. Transient mask-off activities such as food tasting are not allowed during this period. This is in line with the cessation of indoor mask-off activities under Phase Two (Heightened Alert).
