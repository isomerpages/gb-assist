## General requirements

To ensure a safe working environment,  businesses are required to abide by the [nation-wide general requirements for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}. Businesses are also required to adhere to the [sector-specific requirements](/safemanagement/sector/), and comply with [measures to facilitate contact tracing](/safemanagement/safeentry/).

All businesses should take note of the following:

-	Work-from-home will continue to be the default at workplaces. Employers must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so.

-   Employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours. 

-   Social gatherings at the workplace will not be allowed. Employees should have their meal breaks at the workplace individually.

-	Any applicable sector-specific requirements
