This guide is updated as of 23 June 2021, 2000 hours. 

#### 1.	Mandatory Fast and Easy Testing (FET) for staff as we move towards a safe and gradual resumption of F&B dine-in Activities

1.1	As announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 18 June 2021, a Fast and Easy Testing (FET) regime will be progressively rolled out for all outlet employees at dine-in F&B establishments from 21 June 2021 onwards, and be mandatory from mid-July 2021.This is to further reduce the risk of transmission in settings with unmasked clients/patrons. These employees are required to be on a regular FET regime using tests such as the antigen rapid test (ART), regardless of their vaccination status.

**1.2	All dine-in F&B establishments (including restaurants, cafes, food courts, coffee shops, hawker stalls) must ensure that their outlet employees undergo FET every 14 days. This includes all full time and part time employees, as well as third-party contracted employees (e.g. cleaners) who work at the establishments.**

1.3	This FET regime is being imposed under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations. Failure to comply with the requirements set out herein may result in prosecution and/or other enforcement action, including suspension/closure of operations<sup>1</sup>.

1.4	FET can be done through one of two ways:

1.4.1.	F&B establishments such as restaurants, restaurants, cafes, food courts, coffee shops and canteens are encouraged to conduct Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (ESSS), where employees will swab themselves under the supervision of a trained staff (‘supervisor’). Supervision can be done either on-site at the workplace or virtually using tools such as video conferencing. To conduct ESSS, establishments will need to undergo training provided by the Government to supervise employees’ self-swabs. 

1.4.2.	For small businesses in hawker centres that might not be able to organise the supervised self-swabs on their own, the relevant government agencies will progressively reach out to business owners and provide a sign up link for their employees to secure an appointment at Quick Test Centres (QTCs)<sup>2</sup>. 

1.5	For ESSS, ART kits will be provided. The costs for the kits and training for employees will be borne by the Government for 3 months, until 30 September 2021.

#### 2.	Employer-Supervised Self Swab (ESSS): Overview 

2.1 For FET under Employer-Supervised Self Swab (ESSS), workers will swab themselves under the supervision of a trained staff (‘supervisor’). Supervision can be done either on-site at the workplace or virtually using tools such as video conferencing.

2.2 The self swab can be done either at the workplace or at home, and will take approximately 10-15 minutes. 

2.3 All employees must check for acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms prior to taking the self-swab. Only employees with no ARI symptoms should continue with the FET. Employees with ARI symptoms should not continue with the ART but instead consult a doctor for medical treatment immediately.

2.4 The ESSS process is summarised as follows:

<ins>Workflow for employees taking supervised self-swab home</ins>
![FET](/images/covid/FastAndEastTestingFNB2.JPG "FET")
*Note: Employers should confirm with employees that they do not have any of the following prior to the self-swabs: (1) Any frequent nosebleeds? (2) Any operations on face or nose? (3) Any tumors or cancers of nose and throat? (4) Any facial skull or fractures? If employees answer “yes’ to one or more, a contraindicatory process (refer to Section 7 “Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (ESSS): Onsite responsibilities of the supervisor”) will kick in.*

2.3	Following the FET tests, F&B establishments are to upload the ART results of their employees into the national Swab Registration System (SRS) within the same day.

2.4	More details on the ESSS process, as well as requirements pre-, during and post-test, can be found in the following sections. 

#### 3. Employer-Supervised Self Swabs: Registering for Supervisory Training

3.1 F&B establishments conducting ESSS are advised to nominate up to two employees per outlet to attend a 4-hour virtual Supervisory Training in ART Self-Swab conducted by the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) appointed vendor, HMI Institute. The training will equip employees with the knowledge needed to supervise the conduct of ART operations.

#### 7.	Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (ESSS): Onsite responsibilities of the supervisor

7.1.	Before commencing the swab process, the supervisor needs to ensure:

- The worker does not display any ARI symptoms;
- The worker does not have any contraindications (e.g. has not had any nosebleed (past 24 hours), facial surgery (last 8 weeks), nasal surgery (last 4 weeks);
- IPC measures are observed (disinfect area after swab)
- Swab processes of workers are of an approved standard;
- Safe Management Measures (SMM) are observed;
- Attendance-taking and collection of results.

7.2.	Prior to the worker’s arrival at the swab site, the supervisor must ensure that SafeEntry and temperature taking has be done. Individuals with ARI symptoms should be denied entry and asked to see a doctor immediately. 

7.3.	The supervisor must ensure that individuals with contraindications are assessed accordingly: 

- Contraindications to Nasopharyngeal (NP) or MT swab: If patient has any facial/nose surgery, base of skull fracture, nose/throat cancer or nosebleed conditions, refer to medical personnel (doctor, nurse) or procedural supervisor onsite for assessment whether swab can proceed. If unable to proceed, to perform ONLY oropharyngeal (OP) swab. If no medical personnel onsite, refer to offsite medical personnel;
- Contraindications to OP swab: If patient has any difficulty in opening their mouth, major head and neck surgery with altered anatomy or flaps, or difficulty swallowing, but does not have the contraindications outlined in #1, to perform ONLY NP swab as per the NP specimen collection SOP;
- Contraindications to NP/MT/OP swab: If patient has contraindications to both NP and OP/MT specimen collection, to refer to their specialist or an ENT specialist for swab. 

7.4.	The supervisor should ensure the following items are pre-placed at each swab station:

- A small standing mirror (for individuals to administer self-swabs);
- A box of 70% alcohol wipes for wipe down of the mirror and the environment before and after swabbing;

#### 9.	Employer-Supervised Self Swab (ESSS): Managing AG+ cases (FET at the workplace)

9.1.	Employees who obtain AG+ results should be checked again for ARI symptoms. 

9.2.	IF ARI symptoms are detected, the employer should contact the Case Management Task Group (6435-4060) to arrange for conveyance of the individual to a Swab Isolation Facility for isolation and a confirmatory PCR test.

9.3.	If no ARI symptoms are detected, the employer should arrange for the employee to be sent to a SASH PHPC for a confirmatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. More details on this are as follows:

a.	The employer must call the SASH PHPC in advance to make an appointment. The employer must also confirm that the worker is able to obtain a confirmatory PCR test during their visit prior to sending the worker down. The list of SASH PHPCs can be found [here](https://flu.gowhere.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}.<br/>

b.	The employer must issue a referral note (refer to attachment [here](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/covid-19/fet/annex-b--template-for-employer-referral-letter-for-ag-or-double-invalid-cases.pdf?la=en){:target="_blank"} for template; sample shown below). The worker must bring this referral note (signed by the employer) and his or her NRIC for subsequent verification at the PHPC.<br/>

|6|GrabSHN, Go-Jek, Ryde, MVL(TADA)|Via respective providers’ app|

e.	When booking private transport, the employer/worker must inform the hotline operator that the worker is going to a SASH PHPC for his or her swab test. For booking through mobile apps, the employer/worker must key “SHN” in the chat/note/comment box or check the SHN checkbox (if provided within the app).

f.	Following the PCR test, the worker must self-isolate at home until the PCR results are returned. If the worker is unable to self-isolate at own place of residence, the SASH PHPC will help arrange for conveyance to a Swab Isolation Facility. 

g.	The worker must wait for the PCR test result:
- If the PCR test returns a negative result, the worker can return to work/go about his or her daily life;
- If the PCR test returns a positive result. Public Health Actions (conveyance to the hospital, contact tracing etc.) will commence. 

#### 10. Employer-Supervised Self Swab (ESSS): Managing AG+ cases (FET at home)

10.1 The worker should visit a SASH PHPC for PCR test. He or she should call the SASH PHPC to make an appointment before heading down. More details on this are as follows:

a.	The employer should not travel to the SASH PHPC by public transport. If transport is required, he or she should travel by private transport (e.g. car or taxi with windows wound down and air conditioning switched off). The employee should be reminded to wear a surgical mask and sit alone in the back seat (on the other side from driver). Seats should be wiped down at the end of the trip.

b.	The employee should present his or her NRIC, as well as a clear photo of his or her ART results at the SASH PHPC clinic for verification. The used ART kit should not be brought to the clinic.

c.	Following the PCR test, the worker must self-isolate at home until the PCR results are returned. If the worker is unable to self-isolate at own place of residence, the SASH PHPC will help arrange for conveyance to a Swab Isolation Facility. 

d.	The worker must wait for the PCR test result:

- If the PCR test returns a negative result, the worker can return to work/go about his or her daily life;
- If the PCR test returns a positive result. Public Health Actions (conveyance to the hospital, contact tracing etc.) will commence.
