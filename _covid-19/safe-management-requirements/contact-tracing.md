## Contact tracing

From 26 April 2022, MOH will stop issuing Health Risk Notices (HRNs) to close contacts. However, persons should continue to exercise social responsibility. For example, COVID-19 positive persons should inform their close contacts so that the contacts can take the necessary precautions under Protocol 3, i.e. test themselves to be negative before leaving their homes, to prevent further spread.

Notwithstanding, the public is strongly encouraged to keep the TraceTogether application on their phones as well as their TraceTogether tokens, to enable us to rapidly step up contact tracing should we need to do so again in response to a new Variant of Concern. 

### 1. SafeEntry

From 26 April 2022, most venues will not be required to offer check-ins with the TT application or token, except larger events with more than 500 participants at any one time and certain nightlife establishments, where Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) checks are still required at entry. To facilitate VDS checks, check-ins may be performed using the TraceTogether App or TraceTogether Token (as a default mode) by: 

- Using one's TT App to scan the venue's QR code
- Displaying one's TT Token so that a venue staff can scan the TT Token's QR code (with businesses’ SE Biz App)

Businesses may also accept other forms of checks for vaccination status, including but not limited to:
-	Scanning of NRIC/FIN using the SE Biz App
-	Displaying vaccination status through HealthHub

Businesses can find the full list of acceptable checks in the following two websites:
-	Information on Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures http://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo 
-	Acceptable Documents for Verification of Eligibility for Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (SMMs)  https://go.gov.sg/acceptabledocs 

For avoidance of doubt, all permitted enterprises and event organisers, must still adhere strictly to the prevailing safe management measures.

### 2. SafeEntry Gateway

SafeEntry Gateway was introduced as an additional mode of SafeEntry check-in.

However, the SE Gateway Box cannot check for vaccination status, and therefore cannot be used for VDS checks. With the removal of SE check-in requirements, there is no need to deploy the SE Gateway Box. Nevertheless, businesses should still keep the SE Gateway Box in preparation for future Variants of Concerns. We will provide further instructions for the SE Gateway Box in due course.

### 3. TraceTogether

The TraceTogether programme was a programme to enhance Singapore’s efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through community-driven contact tracing.

From 26 April 2022, MOH will stop issuing Health Risk Notices (HRN) to close contacts. As HRNs will no longer be issued, COVID-19 cases need not upload their TraceTogether data. Their TraceTogether token will also not be collected for data extraction. 

Notwithstanding, the public is strongly encouraged to keep the TraceTogether application on their phones as well as their TraceTogether tokens, to enable us to rapidly step up contact tracing should we need to do so again in response to a new Variant of Concern.
