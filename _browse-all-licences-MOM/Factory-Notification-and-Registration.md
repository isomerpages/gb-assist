### Application Details
<p>The Occupier (e.g. factory owner) of premises defined as factories is required to either notify or register their premises with MOM before operations, to facilitate the management of workplace risk and the implementation of Safety and Health Management Systems. If the factory falls under the definition of a Major Hazard Installation (MHI), the Occupier is required to register the premises as an MHI with MOM, at least 6 months before operations.</p>
