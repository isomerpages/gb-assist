The equipment allows reduction in time and manpower needed for preparation and touch-up work during cutting operations. Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $15,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution38' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Circular Gas Cutter</a><br/><br/><br/>Automatic crawling and portable cutting maching using gas/oxy-fuel for parallel, upright and upward pipe cutting arrangements in workshop or shipyard, especially in tight or awkward spaces. With a permanent magnet wheel attached onto the pipe to crawl and cut the pipe at the same time, this equipment only requires 1 headcount to operate. Time and manpower is saved throughout preparation, cutting and touch-up work.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $10,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution72' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Magnetic Pipe Gas Cutter</a><br/><br/><br/>Automatic crawling and portable cutting maching using gas/oxy-fuel for straight line cutting of steel plates in workshop or shipyard. As the equipment can be easily attached onto steel plates and be fitted with more than 1 nozzle, only 1 headcount is required to operate and manage the cutting operations. Efficient and accurate straight-line cutting by this equipment reduce time needed for preparation and touch-up work.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $5,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution88' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Portable Straight Line Automatic Cutting Machine</a><br/><br/><br/>The power jack provides easy adjustment and fitting of steel pieces into perpendicular arrangement during the construction process in workshop or shipyard. This replaces manual adjustments of hammering process, resulting in lesser time and effort required to prepare the steel plates for the welding process.
