    content: The AMR replaces manual labour in the transportation of materials and semi/fully completed products around the factory floor during production process. As a collaborative robot for automated internal transportation, AMR comes with autonomous functions to identify obstacles and navigate around factory floor without need for markers or coming to a complete stop for an extended period.

The equipment allows reduction in time and manpower needed for preparation and touch-up work during cutting operations. Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $15,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution38' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Circular Gas Cutter</a><br/><br/><br/>Automatic crawling and portable cutting maching using gas/oxy-fuel for parallel, upright and upward pipe cutting arrangements in workshop or shipyard, especially in tight or awkward spaces. With a permanent magnet wheel attached onto the pipe to crawl and cut the pipe at the same time, this equipment only requires 1 headcount to operate. Time and manpower is saved throughout preparation, cutting and touch-up work.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $10,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution72' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Magnetic Pipe Gas Cutter</a><br/><br/><br/>Automatic crawling and portable cutting maching using gas/oxy-fuel for straight line cutting of steel plates in workshop or shipyard. As the equipment can be easily attached onto steel plates and be fitted with more than 1 nozzle, only 1 headcount is required to operate and manage the cutting operations. Efficient and accurate straight-line cutting by this equipment reduce time needed for preparation and touch-up work.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $5,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution88' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Portable Straight Line Automatic Cutting Machine</a><br/><br/><br/>The power jack provides easy adjustment and fitting of steel pieces into perpendicular arrangement during the construction process in workshop or shipyard. This replaces manual adjustments of hammering process, resulting in lesser time and effort required to prepare the steel plates for the welding process. Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $15,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution89' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Power Jack for Steel Plates Adjustment (Perpendicular)</a><br/><br/><br/>A probing system consists of the following attached to CNC machining centerWork Piece Touch Probe Work piece measurement/referencing Tool Setting Probe Tool setting, length, radius, breakage detectionSoftware Creates measurement program for probes on standard geometries and free-form surfaces, generates QC alerts and reportsImplementation Equipment configuration, trainingGrant support 80% of cost of probing system, up to $30,000 grant cap<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution91' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Probing System</a><br/><br/><br/>The butt joint welding alignment tool can be used to efficiently and easily align steel plates in preparation for the welding process during shipbuilding in workshop or shipyard. The tool requires lesser time and manpower for steel plate adjustments, is faster and more accurate, and is safer.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $10,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution134' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Steel Plate Butt Joint Welding Alignment Tool</a><br/><br/><br/>Vertical storage and retrieval system designed to save floor space, maximise vertical space for inventory storage and improve productivity for goods picking. The Carousel consists of carriers that rotate vertically and deliver stored inventory (e.g. spare parts, small parcels, electronic components) to the operator on the ground.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $30,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution165' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Vertical Carousel</a><br/><br/><br/>This solution uses AR technology to simulate welding processes on test pieces. The learning management and student analysis software provides structured curriculum with stimulated exercises and lab practices while tracking trainees' progress. This solution enables more practice with less time spent in workshop, thus reducing material usage, training preparation time/cost, and exposure to safety/health hazards.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $30,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution268' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Augmented Reality Welding Training Solution</a><br/><br/><br/>Access to intended in-situ work/inspection/repair locations onboard vessels are usually through the use of scaffolds or rope access operated manually. The process is time-consuming and is physically exhausting. The battery-powered rope ascender can help shipyard/workshop personnel ascend faster,  reduce physical strain on the body and take fewer rest breaks compared to the manual method. This would result in efficiency and productivity improvement.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1142' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Battery-Powered Rope Ascender</a><br/><br/><br/>In the M&O industry, geometric alignment and measurement are needed in many applications such as shaft alignment, line bore applications, flatness/ straightness measurement and machine tool alignment. Traditional alignment methods include visual inspection combined with a straightedge or use of dial indicators, which are inaccurate and time consuming.Laser geometric alignment systems are quick and easy to deploy, and accurate results can be consistently obtained with minimal rework.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1143' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Laser Geometric Alignment System</a><br/><br/><br/>Welding is usually carried out manually by welders or operators of an auto welding carriage. An auto welding carriage mounted to the side-wall can do multiple welding jobs at once, similar to a panel line system with 1 unit being the Master control while the remaining units (min. 2) follow suit using wireless communication. Production line with either 6 or 12 units will only require 1 to 2 welding operators per shift to operate the Master machine while monitoring the overall welding job.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1144' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Auto Welding Carriage for T-beam/ Stiffener Multiple Welds</a><br/><br/><br/>Consists of digital welding machines (hardware) and management software- Compute actual real-time output of voltage, reducing manual recording and computing- Allow real-time monitoring of multiple weld stations to ensure welding works are compliant - Provide data logging to track welders' performance/ productivity- Monitor power consumption and consumables- User can pre-set/control welding parameters and optimise voltage applied<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1286' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Digital Welding Equipment </a><br/>
