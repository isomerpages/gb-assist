These scavengers are put into small packets and inserted alongside the packaged product. An oxygen scavenger dispenser works by integrating with a production line and automatically inserting these oxygen scavenger packets with each packaged product.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $30,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution306' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Automated Oxygen Scavenger Dispenser</a><br/><br/><br/>The automatic tray sealer only requires employees to fill up trays with the product (e.g. meat, buns, pasta) and it will automatically seal up each batch.Typically, these machines can seal several trays at once. Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $30,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution307' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Automated Tray Sealer</a><br/><br/><br/>The filing and seaming machine automates the filing and seaming of canned beverages. Operators will only need to load the machine with the product. Each can in the production line will be filled to the desired level, checked (by weight or volume), and subsequently heat sealed shut.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $30,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution308' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Filing and Seaming Machine</a><br/><br/><br/>Commercial inkjet printers integrated into the production lines are used to stamp information directly onto the product packaging. They allow the company to print specific information to individual product packets like bar codes, product information, expiry date. Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $24,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution309' target='_blank' style='color:#037e8a'>Commercial Inkjet Printer</a><br/><br/><br/>The vacuum packaging machine is used to vacuum seal products in a plastic wrap. Products are placed in trays and then loaded into the vacuum chambers, after which a plastic film will be used to seal in the product. The alternative to this machine is for workers to manually seal products with cling packaging, without guarantees of a strong vacuum seal.
