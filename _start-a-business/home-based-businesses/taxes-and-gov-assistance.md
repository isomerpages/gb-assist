### How to register a business

Registering a business involves two transactions: applying for a business name followed by business registration. Go to [Step 3](/start-a-business/reserve-your-business-name/) (Reserve your business name) to find out how to apply for a business name.
Once the name has been approved, you can proceed with business registration.


There are three ways to register your business:

**For Sole Proprietorship/Partnership:**

1. [Register directly through GoBusiness](https://dashboard.gobusiness.gov.sg/login?src=startbiz_reg){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"};

    i. Log in using your Singpass

    ii. Use Guided Journey to continue with the next step to register your Sole Proprietorship/Partnership

**For all types of business structures:**

1. [Register directly through BizFile+](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/ngbbizfileinternet/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pages/BizfileHomepage.jspx#/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}; or

2. Engage a registered filing agent (e.g: law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit an online application on your behalf.

The pre-requisites, information and supporting documents needed for the application to register the business will vary, depending on the business structure type. Click on the respective business structure to find out more.

### Unique Entity Number (UEN) and Business Profile

Upon successful registration of your new business, your business will be issued a [Unique Entity Number (UEN)](https://www.uen.gov.sg/ueninternet/faces/pages/admin/aboutUEN.jspx){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. The UEN is your business' unique identification number that will be used in all transactions with government agencies.

A [free copy of Business Profile](https://www.acra.gov.sg/about-bizfile/updates-and-announcements/provision-of-free-business-profiles){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for your business will be emailed to the person filing the application.
