## Step 5: Take your business further

![Corppass](/images/start/StartSJ_Corppass account.jpg)

Now that you've registered your business, the next thing you must have to transact with Singapore Government agencies is a Corppass Administrator (Admin) account. Corppass is a single corporate digital identity for your business, accessed via your personal Singpass. Each business entity can have up to 2 Corppass Admins.

**Corppass Admins can do the following:**

- Manage users' access to digital services
- Customise digital service access of individual users within the entity
- Authorise third party service providers to transact on your behalf for selected digital services

[Set up your Corppass Admin account here](https://www.Corppass.gov.sg/Corppass/common/findoutmore){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
