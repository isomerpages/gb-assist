## Protect your ideas

![Protect your ideas](/images/start/StartSJ_StartSJ_TrademarksIP.jpg)

Your inventions, designs and representations of your brand are Intellectual Property (IP) assets that can be protected. Having a strong IP portfolio can open up commercial opportunities for your business such as research & development (R&D) partnerships, securing investments, licensing and franchising. Whether you are a budding entrepreneur, a start-up, a SME or an MNC, take time to consider the best way to manage IP for your business growth.

Common forms of IP are trade marks (representation of your brands), patents (your inventions) and designs. Find out more at [IPOS website](https://www.ipos.gov.sg/about-ip){:target="_blank"}.

Generally, a good time to file for protection of your IP is before launching your product or service, so that no one can take advantage of your IP without your permission. If you are considering filing a patent application to protect your invention, it should preferably be done before you disclose your invention publicly to third parties (eg: potential collaborators) to avoid failing to satisfy one of the qualifying criteria. You can [book a complimentary consultation on IP strategies](https://www.ipos.gov.sg/e-services/e-appointment){:target="_blank"} via IP Business Clinic, a service offered by Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS).
