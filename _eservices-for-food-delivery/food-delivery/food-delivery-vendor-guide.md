## Welcome to the Food Delivery Vendor Guide!

The following table filters out the key features in choosing your ideal food delivery company.

**Commission Prices:** The price margin which you pay the food delivery vendor upon every order.
(E.g. If your dish costs $4.00, a commission price of 20% will mean you earn $4.00 * (100 – 20)% = $3.20 for every dish sold on the delivery platform)

**Rider Base Size:** The approximate number of food delivery riders in Singapore for that particular delivery vendor.

**Consumer Base Size:** The approximate number of Singaporeans who order food via the delivery vendor’s online platform.

**Unique Selling Points:** The most prominent strengths of each food delivery vendor.
