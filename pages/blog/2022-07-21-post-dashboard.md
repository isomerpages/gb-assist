Businesses can also keep track of all their licence applications on the Dashboard. The task overview allows you to easily keep track of pending applications, and informs you when there is action required on your part.

The Dashboard will ensure you always have an eye on which stage of application your licence is at, and prompt you to renew your licences when they are close to expiry, so you no longer need to worry about missed deadlines!
