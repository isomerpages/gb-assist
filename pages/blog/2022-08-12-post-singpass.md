Looking to digitalise your services and operations to improve efficiency? Singpass’ suite of services may be just what you need – from user registration to identity verification, [Singpass’ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)](https://api.singpass.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} can be integrated with your businesses’ systems to create a trusted digital ecosystem and transform your business. 

Check out how Singpass’ APIs can help to smoothen business processes for you and your customers alike!

### 1. Easily verify your customer’s identity for in-person transactions

With in-person activities and visits ramping up again, you can use [Verify](https://api.singpass.gov.sg/library/verify/business/introduction){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to make customer identity authentication more efficient. This API enables your business to securely conduct in-person verification of your customer’s identity, through scanning a QR code with the Singpass app. Ideal for businesses that require face to face verification of customers’ details, this helps to do so without having to manage physical NRICs or FIN cards. 

Verify is a trusted resource for businesses, and is currently being used at [SingHealth polyclinics](https://polyclinic.singhealth.com.sg/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for registering new patients, as well as for donor tax exemption registrations on the [GivePlease](https://www.givepls.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} platform. It can be especially handy for real estate companies, telecommunications providers and financial institutions, or even services or businesses that require age verification.

### 2. Speed up your eKYC with less form filling and higher data quality

Reduce time spent on filling out forms with Myinfo! With [Myinfo](https://api.singpass.gov.sg/library/myinfo/introduction){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, your customers can pre-fill digital forms for online transactions with their personal data from trusted government sources. This eliminates the need for customers to manually fill in forms and submit physical documents for verification, enabling businesses to enjoy a smoother and more efficient customer acquisition process. 

Myinfo is one of Singpass’ most popular services and sees more than 200,000 transactions a day. Over 700 digital services offered by government agencies and businesses have adopted Myinfo. 

This has increased efficiency, with an average decrease of up to 80 per cent in application time for users, and businesses reporting up to 15 per cent higher approval rate in their customer acquisition process due to better data quality, as well as significant cost savings to their business. 

Similar to Myinfo, [Myinfo business](https://api.singpass.gov.sg/library/myinfobiz/business/introduction){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} enables businesses to pre-fill digital forms with information on the business entity from government sources, such as corporate profile, financial performance and ownership information. Users can leverage Myinfo Business for G2B digital services such as applying for a grant on the GoBusiness Business Grants Portal and invoicing agencies on Vendors@Gov.

### 3. No more remembering passwords!

We’ve all been there: trying to remember our password for the umpteenth time, and having to go through the trouble of changing it yet again. Why not use [Singpass’ Login](https://api.singpass.gov.sg/library/login/business/introduction){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to help your customers save the hassle? Using Login provides your customers with high assurance authentication to access your digital services quickly and conveniently. Using their Singpass app, your customers simply have to scan a QR code provided by your business and authenticate themselves with their biometrics or six-digit passcode. 

Login also saves your business time and money otherwise needed to maintain and operate additional infrastructure and systems. It’s a win-win situation!

### 4. Simply have your customers scan their face for secure authentication

Make face recognition services more secure with [Identiface](https://api.singpass.gov.sg/library/identiface/business/introduction){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. A secure authentication method that enables your customers to access your company’s digital services on their desktop or mobile devices conveniently, this uses a face scan compared against the Government’s biometric database. 

Using Identiface is simple, allowing less tech-savvy users and the elderly to seamlessly and securely use Identiface. 

Don’t worry about having to build a biometric database – bundled SDKs and APIs allow for easy integration and better security, along with Presentation Attack Detection technology as a preventive measure against impersonation. 

Identiface can also be layered upon your business’s existing authentication processes to provide your customers with multi-factor authentication, especially for transactions that involve sensitive information or high monetary value.
