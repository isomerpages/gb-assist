#### Description

The hydraulic nut splitter is used to cut through nuts within seconds. It is very useful for removing corroded nuts where a torque tool is unable to loosen the nut. It is also safer to operate as there are no open flames unlike using traditional torching. The risk of the operator injuring his hands is also lower as compared to using hammar and chisel. Time is also saved during operation.
