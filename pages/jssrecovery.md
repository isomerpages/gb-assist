title: FAQ ON RECTIFICATION OF EXCESS PAYMENT IN JOBS SUPPORT SCHEME PAYOUTS
permalink: /faq/jssrecovery
---

## General

#### 1. Why did I receive this email/ letter?
Your received this email/letter email because your business was paid in excess of the intended amount during the October 2020 JSS payout.

#### 2. How did this happen?
JSS payouts post-CB are computed based on when businesses are approved to reopen. Businesses which are not allowed to operate will receive the highest tier of JSS support (i.e. Tier 1) until they are approved to operate when they revert to base tier. 

The excess payment occurred due to human and coding errors in the compilation and processing of reopening dates which was used for the computation of payouts. Throughout CB and the reopening phases, businesses received various approvals for resumption of different activities. Some businesses were wrongly assigned later reopening dates from ancilliary approvals/permissions granted for non-core activities even though they had already been permitted to resume their core business activities earlier. This resulted in businesses being deemed to be “closed” for a longer period of time and allocated more days of JSS at Tier 1 level, hence being paid in excess. 

#### 3. Will this affect my other related businesses? 
Data processing and computation for JSS is entity-specific. You will be formally notified via email and letter should your business entity be affected. You may also log in to <a href="http://go.gov.sg/excessJSS" style="color:#037e8a">http://go.gov.sg/excessJSS</a> using your CorpPass to check on the details for each business entity.

#### 4. Will this happen again?
To prevent any potential recurrence, MTI has worked with MOF and IRAS to rectify the process such that the actual sector-based reopening date of businesses will take precedence over other ancillary approvals granted by other government agencies. We have also instituted additional checks to detect and flag possible errors before future payouts are made.

#### 5. I only received the email and the excess payment amount is not mentioned. How do I check the excess payment amount for my business?
The excess payment amount and number of excess days allocated is included in the letter that has been mailed to your business registered address with ACRA. 

You may also log in to <a href="http://go.gov.sg/excessJSS" style="color:#037e8a">http://go.gov.sg/excessJSS</a> using your CorpPass to check on the details for your business. 

#### 6. How can I be sure that my business is getting the right amount of JSS?
You may use the JSS Calculator at <a href="http://go.gov.sg/jss" style="color:#037e8a">http://go.gov.sg/jss</a> to compute the amount of JSS your business is entitled to for each payout. You may also obtain a breakdown of the JSS payout for your business using the JSS breakdown request e-service. 

If you have further queries on the specific JSS payout amount for your business, please reach out to IRAS.

#### 7. How will the excess payment be recovered?
To minimise additional effort and inconvenience for businesses, the excess payment will be offset by deducting from subsequent JSS payouts, starting from the upcoming payment on 30 March 2021. This will be done automatically and no further action is required from you at this point. 

Deductions will be frontloaded, and the balance be deducted from subsequent payouts until the full amount has been deducted. Businesses that have insufficient future payouts for full deduction will be informed separately after their final JSS payout on the actions needed to return the outstanding excess amount. You will be given the option to return either by lumpsum or by instalments.

More details on how deductions will be made are given in the illustration below.

*Illustration 1 – Future JSS payouts sufficient for deduction of excess*

Assuming the excess paid to Business A in October 2020 was $1,000 and their original allocation for the March and June payouts is $800 and $700 respectively. The March payout will be deducted in full to cover the excess amount, and the June payout will be deducted subsequently to cover the outstanding excess after the March deduction. After the deduction, Business A will receive $500 balance payment in the June JSS payout.

*Illustration 2 – Future JSS payouts insufficient for deduction of excess amount*

Assuming the excess paid to Business B in October 2020 was $1,000, and their original allocation for the March and June payouts is $400 and $300 respectively. Both payouts will be deducted in full to cover the excess amount. If June is their final payout, Business B will need to return the $300 in cash after their final payout.

#### 8. How will I know if my business still going to receive any payments in the March JSS payouts?
IRAS is in the process of making adjustments to take into account the offset. A second notification letter will be sent to you on the net balance after offset you can expect to receive in the March payout by the last week of March. If you have a preferred mailing address, please inform us by 27 March 2021 via <a href="http://go.gov.sg/ReopeningDate" style="color:#037e8a">http://go.gov.sg/ReopeningDate</a>.

#### 9. How can I estimate how much more JSS my business will be allocated and when the final payout for my business will be?
The level and duration of support for JSS depends on the sector in which your business operates. Please refer to <a href="http://go.gov.sg/jss" style="color:#037e8a">http://go.gov.sg/jss</a> (under the subheader ‘How each payout is computed’) for the list of sectors and JSS entitlement for each sector for subsequent payouts.

You may also use the JSS Calculator to compute the amount of JSS your business is entitled to for each of the subsequent payouts. 

#### 10. Can I opt not to have the excess amount offset from my JSS payouts? What other options do I have to return the excess?
The deductions from the upcoming payout in March is automatic. After the March deductions, if you would like to return the remaining excess amount upfront rather than wait for subsequent offsets, you may do so. 

A second notification letter will be sent to your business registered address with ACRA by the last week of March stating the outstanding excess amount after the March offset that needs to be returned. Please wait for this notification before returning the excess amount. You may also log in to http://go.gov.sg/excessJSS using your CorpPass to check for updates on the oustanding excess amount from 28 March 2021 onwards.
