## New GoBusiness feature: e-Advisers for Events

![events-eadviser](/images/news/News_Events eAdviser launch.jpg)

GoBusiness has launched [e-Adviser for Events](https://eadviser.g2b.sg/events), a new feature to help event organisers find out which licences and permits they need to organise a physical event in Singapore.

**Examples of event types:**

**Sports events** with mass participation or spectatorship (eg: marathons, tournaments, competitions)

**Business-oriented events** which are not held for individual consumers to attend (eg: meetings, conferences, exhibitions)

**Arts/culture events** that are social and recreational in nature (eg: festivals, performances, fairs)

**Business-to-Consumer (B2C) events** to promote products (eg: book fairs), services (eg: insurance roadshows, wedding expos, travel fairs) or food (eg: food expos, pasar malam), for consumers in the domestic market

### How does e-Adviser for Events work?

Event organisers simply need to answer a series of questions about their event, to get a personalised set of recommendations on what to do next. The e-Adviser also lists the licences and permits needed for the event.
