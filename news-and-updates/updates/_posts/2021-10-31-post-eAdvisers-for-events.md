## New GoBusiness feature: e-Advisers for Events

![events-eadviser](/images/news/News_Events eAdviser launch.jpg)

GoBusiness has launched [e-Adviser for Events](https://eadviser.g2b.sg/events), a new feature to help event organisers find out which licences and permits they need to organise a physical event in Singapore.

### How does e-Adviser for Events work?

Event organisers simply need to answer a series of questions about their event, to get a personalised set of recommendations on what to do next. The e-Adviser also lists the licences and permits needed for the event.
