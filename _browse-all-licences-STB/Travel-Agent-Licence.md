### Application Details

<p>There are 2 types of travel agent licences:</p>
<p><strong>Niche Licence</strong></p>
<p>Under the Travel Agents Regulations 2017, a Niche licence is a licence that is subject to a condition restricting the licensee granted the licence to supply only tours within Singapore without any right of accommodation. An example of such a tour is a sit-in coach day tour. The Niche licence has minimum financial requirements of $50,000.</p>
<p><strong>General Licence</strong></p>
<p>Under the Travel Agents Regulations 2017, a General licence is a licence that is not a Niche licence, i.e. it is a licence for travel agents conducting any other activity beyond what is described in the scope of a Niche licence. The General licence has minimum financial requirements of $100,000.</p>
